Cover Letter: Director Infrastructure Solution Delivery at Novartis

Dear Novartis Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Director Infrastructure Solution Delivery position in Barcelona. With over 25 years of IT leadership experience, including recent roles as Associate Director of Architecture at IQVIA and Engineering Director at Veepee, I am excited about the opportunity to lead infrastructure solutions that drive Novartis's digital transformation and business objectives.

Strategic Infrastructure Leadership

At IQVIA, I created the entire architecture documentation framework from scratch, establishing the technical foundation for a data-driven platform that supports critical business operations. This experience directly aligns with your need for strategic infrastructure leadership that ensures solutions are not only technically sound but also aligned with business goals. I have a proven track record of translating complex technical requirements into scalable, reliable infrastructure solutions that enable organizational growth.

Pharmaceutical Industry Expertise

My background includes significant experience in the pharmaceutical and life sciences sector. At IQVIA, I led architecture initiatives for healthcare data platforms, and at Firmenich, I managed global mobility solutions across 37 countries while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. This industry knowledge, combined with my technical expertise, positions me to understand the unique infrastructure challenges and compliance considerations that Novartis faces in delivering mission-critical solutions.

Proven Track Record in Infrastructure Management

During my tenure as IT Engineering Manager at Veepee, I managed three teams responsible for private cloud infrastructure, internet services, and SRE operations, the Tech for the Tech foundation that enabled the entire organization. I oversaw the design, implementation, and optimization of infrastructure solutions that supported high-availability, scalable systems processing millions of transactions. My experience in breaking down silos between teams and establishing clear ownership models directly translates to orchestrating cross-functional infrastructure delivery at Novartis.

Business Alignment and Stakeholder Management

Throughout my career, I have excelled at aligning IT infrastructure initiatives with strategic business objectives. At Veepee, I worked closely with business stakeholders to ensure that infrastructure investments directly supported product delivery and business outcomes. I am skilled at communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and building consensus around infrastructure roadmaps that balance innovation, cost optimization, and business needs.

Leadership and Team Development

I have successfully led large, distributed engineering teams, most notably managing a 50+ person tribe across nine products and two countries at Veepee. I am passionate about developing technical talent, establishing clear technical standards, and fostering a culture of excellence. My approach combines hands-on technical guidance with strategic leadership, ensuring that infrastructure teams are both technically strong and aligned with organizational goals.

Why Novartis

Novartis's commitment to reimagining medicine through innovative technology resonates deeply with my career focus on delivering infrastructure solutions that enable meaningful business impact. The opportunity to lead infrastructure solution delivery in Barcelona, working within a global organization that values both technical excellence and patient outcomes, represents the next logical step in my career.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to Novartis's infrastructure transformation and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in strategic infrastructure leadership, pharmaceutical industry knowledge, and proven ability to deliver scalable solutions can support your team's objectives.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
