## 📋 What Was Built

### 🔐 Feature 1: Password Reset / Forgot Password
**User Flow:**
1. Member clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. Enters their email address
3. Receives email with secure reset link (1-hour expiration)
4. Clicks link → enters new password
5. Redirected to login with new password

**Technical Implementation:**
- Secure token generation (64-character hex)
- Database table: `password_reset_tokens`
- Token expiration (1 hour)
- Single-use tokens
- Email enumeration protection
- Automatic cleanup of old tokens

**Files Created:**
- `api/password-reset-request.php` - Request handler

5. Can resend verification email if needed

**Technical Implementation:**
- Verification token generated on registration
- New columns in `members` table:
  - `email_verified` (boolean)
  - `email_verification_token` (64-char string)
  - `email_verified_at` (datetime)
- Login validation checks verification status
- Automatic welcome email after verification

**Files Created:**
