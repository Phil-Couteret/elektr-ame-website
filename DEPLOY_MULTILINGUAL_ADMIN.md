## 📦 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Wait for GitHub Actions** (2-3 minutes)

   - Wait for the latest workflow to complete (green checkmark ✓)

### 2. **Download the Build Artifact**
   - Click on the latest completed workflow
   - Scroll down to "Artifacts"
   - Download **`elektr-ame-build`**
   - Unzip the downloaded file

### 3. **Upload to OVH via FTP**

Upload these files from the unzipped artifact:

```
From artifact:                     To OVH:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
dist/index.html                 →  www/index.html
dist/assets/index-DhbNXa4V.js  →  www/assets/index-DhbNXa4V.js
dist/assets/index-eTVpQDw1.css →  www/assets/index-eTVpQDw1.css
```

**Important:** Make sure to upload in **Binary mode**!

### 4. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - In your browser, go to `https://www.elektr-ame.com/admin`
   - Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)
   - This ensures you see the new version

   - "Back to Home" button

### Test Language Selector

2. Look for the **globe icon** (🌐) in the header
3. Click it and select:
   - **English** - should show "Admin Panel", "Events", "Members", etc.

## 💾 How Language Preference Works

- When a user selects a language, it's saved in the browser's `localStorage`
- The preference persists across sessions
- Each user can have their own language preference
- The language applies to the entire admin panel

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Language selector not visible?
- Make sure you cleared your browser cache (hard refresh)
- Check that the new JavaScript file is loaded (check browser DevTools → Network tab)

### Text still in English after switching language?
- Hard refresh the page (`Cmd + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`)
- Check browser console for errors

### Members tab shows errors?
- Verify that all API files are uploaded to OVH
- Check that `api/members-list.php` and `api/members-export.php` are accessible

## 📝 Notes

- The main website (non-admin pages) already had multi-language support
