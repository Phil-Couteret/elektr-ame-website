# .htaccess Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status

‚úÖ HTTPS redirect is working!

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: PWA Install Prompt Still Not Showing

**Cause:** Browser cache or old service worker

**Solution:**
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. **Hard refresh** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Unregister old service worker:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Application ‚Üí Service Workers
   - Click "Unregister" on old service worker
   - Refresh page
4. **Test in incognito/private mode**

### Issue 2: API Calls Failing

**Cause:** .htaccess might be blocking API routes

**Solution:** I've updated the .htaccess to explicitly allow API calls.

If still failing, use the minimal version:
1. Upload `.htaccess.minimal` instead of `.htaccess`
2. Rename it to `.htaccess` on server

---

### Issue 3: Pages Not Loading / 500 Errors

**Cause:** Server doesn't support certain .htaccess directives

**Solutions:**

**Option A: Use Minimal .htaccess (Safest)**
```apache
# Just HTTPS redirect, nothing else
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</IfModule>
```

**Option B: Let OVH Handle HTTPS**
1. Delete .htaccess from server
2. In OVH Control Panel ‚Üí Enable "Force HTTPS" option
3. PWA will still work!

**Option C: No .htaccess at All**
If your OVH hosting already forces HTTPS:
- Don't upload .htaccess
- PWA will work fine!

## How to Test What's Working

### 1. Check HTTPS
```
Visit: http://www.elektr-ame.com
Should redirect to: https://www.elektr-ame.com
Look for padlock üîí in address bar
```

### 2. Check Service Worker
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Console tab
3. Look for: "[PWA] Service Worker registered successfully"
4. Application tab ‚Üí Service Workers
5. Should see service-worker.js status: activated
```

### 3. Check Manifest
```
1. DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Manifest
2. Should show:
   - Name: Elektr-√Çme
   - Start URL: /
   - Icons: 8 icons loaded
   - No errors
```

### 4. Check Install Prompt
```
Desktop:
- Visit site
- Wait 5 seconds
- Custom install prompt appears (electric blue box)
- OR: Look in address bar for install icon

Mobile:
- Visit site in Chrome/Safari
- Browser menu ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen" / "Install"

## Which .htaccess to Use?

### Use FULL VERSION (current) if:

- ‚úÖ You want optimized caching

### Use MINIMAL VERSION if:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è API calls failing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pages not loading

---

## Current Files Available

## Quick Fixes
