## 🔧 Configuration

### Update App Name/Colors

Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "Your New Name",
  "short_name": "Short Name",
  "theme_color": "#00D9FF",
  "background_color": "#000000"
}
```

### Update Cache Version

When you make changes, update in `public/service-worker.js`:
```javascript
const CACHE_VERSION = 'elektr-ame-v1.0.1'; // Increment version
```

This forces old caches to be cleared.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Install" button doesn't appear
**Solutions:**
- Check DevTools → Console for errors
- Ensure manifest.json loads correctly
- Verify icons exist (check Application → Manifest)
- Clear cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Old version won't update
**Solutions:**
- Increment `CACHE_VERSION` in service-worker.js
- DevTools → Application → Service Workers → "Unregister"
- Clear cache and reload

### Issue: Offline page not showing
**Solutions:**
- Check that offline.html is uploaded
- Verify service worker is registered
- Check Application → Cache Storage has cached files

### Issue: Icons not showing
**Solutions:**
- Ensure pwa-icons/ folder exists
- Check file names match manifest.json exactly
- Verify file paths in DevTools → Network
