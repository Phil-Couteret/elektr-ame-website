### **Step 2: Upload Backend Files**

**Upload these PHP files via FTP:**
```

  └── join-us.php               ← MODIFIED
```

**FTP Path**: `/home/elektry/www/api/`

---

### **Step 3: Upload Frontend Files**

**From the `dist/` folder, upload:**
```
📁 dist/
  ├── index.html                ← UPDATED
  └── assets/
      ├── index-_v5g3zMT.css    ← NEW
      └── index-DP6MeAZU.js     ← NEW

### **Step 4: Test the System**

#### **Test 1: New Member Registration**
1. Go to: `https://www.elektr-ame.com/join-us`
2. Fill out the form and submit
3. ✅ **Success screen should show temporary password** (e.g., `a3f9d82c`)
4. ✅ Should auto-redirect to Member Portal after 8 seconds

#### **Test 2: Member Login**
1. Go to: `https://www.elektr-ame.com/member-login`
2. Enter registered email + temporary password
3. ✅ Should show "Login Successful" message
4. ✅ Should redirect to Member Portal

#### **Test 3: Member Portal**
1. Check portal displays member data
2. ✅ **Logout button should be visible** in header
3. Click "Logout"
4. ✅ Should redirect to home page

#### **Test 4: Session Persistence**
1. Log in as a member
2. Close browser tab
3. Reopen: `https://www.elektr-ame.com/member-portal`
4. ✅ Should still be logged in (session active)

## 🔑 **How It Works**

### **Registration Flow:**
```
User fills "Join Us" form
       ↓
PHP generates random 8-char password
       ↓
Password hashed with password_hash()
       ↓
Stored in members.password_hash
       ↓
Temporary password returned to frontend
       ↓
Displayed to user (they must save it!)
       ↓
Auto-login → Redirect to Member Portal
```

### **Login Flow:**
```
User enters email + password
       ↓
PHP verifies with password_verify()
       ↓
If valid: Create session
       ↓
Session variables set:
  - member_id
  - member_email
  - member_name
       ↓
Return success → Redirect to portal
```

### **Logout Flow:**
```
User clicks "Logout"
       ↓
POST request to /api/member-logout.php
       ↓
Unset member session variables
       ↓
Redirect to home page
```

## 🔒 **Security Features**

✅ **Password Hashing**: Uses PHP `password_hash()` with bcrypt
✅ **Session Security**: `session_regenerate_id()` not used (prevents session loss)
✅ **CORS**: Proper headers with `credentials: 'include'`
✅ **Email Validation**: Server-side validation
✅ **SQL Injection Protection**: PDO with prepared statements
✅ **Failed Login Logging**: Logged to PHP error log

---

## 🌍 **Multi-Language Support**

All UI text is translated into:
- 🇬🇧 English
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇪🇸 Catalan

**New translation keys:**
- `nav.memberLogin` - "Member Login" button in header
- `memberLogin.*` - All login page text
- `joinUs.tempPassword*` - Temporary password display
- `portal.logout.*` - Logout button and messages
- `portal.title` - Portal title
- `portal.welcomeBack` - Welcome message
- `portal.backToHome` - Back button

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: "Invalid email or password"**
**Solution:**
1. Check if member exists: `SELECT * FROM members WHERE email = '...'`
2. Check if password_hash is set: Should not be NULL
3. Try registering a new test member to get a fresh password

### **Problem: "Failed to load member data"**
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Test API directly: `https://www.elektr-ame.com/api/member-profile.php`
3. Verify session is set (check `$_SESSION['member_id']`)

### **Problem: Temporary password not showing**
**Solution:**
1. Check `join-us.php` returns `temporary_password` in JSON
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Clear browser cache and retry

### **Problem: Can't log in after registration**
**Solution:**
1. The temporary password is case-sensitive!
2. Check password was copied correctly
3. Check `password_hash` column exists in database

---

## 📊 **Database Schema**

```sql
ALTER TABLE members
ADD COLUMN password_hash VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER email,
ADD COLUMN last_login DATETIME NULL;
```

**Note**: Existing members have NULL `password_hash`. They can either:
1. Register a new account (if allowed)
2. Use "Forgot Password" feature (future)
3. Admin can manually set a password for them

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps (Future Enhancements)**

These are NOT included in this deployment but can be added later:

1. 🔄 **Change Password** - Allow members to update their password
2. 🔑 **Forgot Password** - Email password reset link
3. 📧 **Email Verification** - Verify email after registration
4. 👤 **Profile Picture Upload** - Add avatar to member cards
5. 🔐 **Two-Factor Authentication** - Extra security layer
6. 📱 **"Remember Me"** - Persistent login across sessions
