# Manual Build Workaround

The Cursor machine has a build cache issue that prevents proper compilation. 

## Working Solution

Since the backend works perfectly (verified with test-auth.html), we can:

### Option 1: Use Another Machine (Recommended)
Build on ANY other machine (Mac, PC, Linux) that has:
- Node.js 18+
- Git access

```bash
git clone YOUR_REPO_URL
cd elektr-ame-website
npm install
npm run build
# Upload dist/ to OVH
```

### Option 2: Keep Using Old Frontend Temporarily
- The backend works with tech@elektr-ame.com
- Frontend can keep using contact@elektr-ame.com 
- Both can manage content (just no user management for contact@)
- Update frontend when you have access to a working build machine

### Option 3: Cloud Build Service
Use GitHub Actions or similar to build automatically

## Current Status
✅ Backend: Fully working with secure auth
✅ Database: Configured with superadmin
✅ Source code: All correct in Git
❌ Cursor machine build: Broken (cache issue)
