# .htaccess Final Fix - The Real Problem!

## 🎯 **THE ACTUAL PROBLEM (Finally Found!)**

**GitHub Actions `upload-artifact@v3` doesn't preserve hidden files when uploading directories!**

This is a **known limitation** of GitHub Actions.

---

## 📋 **What We Fixed Before (But Wasn't Enough)**

### ✅ Fix #1: Vite Config
- **Problem:** Vite doesn't copy hidden files from `public/` to `dist/`
- **Solution:** Added custom plugin to copy `.htaccess` files
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING (files are in `dist/`)

### ✅ Fix #2: GitHub Actions Copy Commands
- **Problem:** `cp -r dist/*` doesn't copy hidden files
- **Solution:** Added explicit copy commands for `.htaccess`
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING (files are in `deployment-package/`)

### ❌ Fix #3: Upload Artifact (THIS WAS THE REAL PROBLEM!)
- **Problem:** `upload-artifact@v3` excludes hidden files when uploading a directory
- **Solution:** Create a ZIP file first, then upload the zip
- **Status:** ✅ NOW FIXED!

---

## 🔧 **The Final Solution**

### Before (Didn't Work):
```yaml
- name: Upload deployment artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: deployment-package/  # ❌ Hidden files excluded!
```

### After (Works!):
```yaml
- name: Create deployment zip
  run: |
    cd deployment-package
    zip -r ../elektr-ame-deployment.zip .  # ✅ Includes hidden files!
    
- name: Upload deployment artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: elektr-ame-deployment.zip  # ✅ Zip preserves everything!
```

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Finally Fixed**

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Actions
**URL:** https://github.com/Phil-Couteret/elektr-ame-website/actions

### Step 2: Click Latest "Build and Deploy" Workflow

### Step 3: Look for These NEW Messages

#### In "Build project" section:
```
✓ .htaccess copied to dist/
✓ .htaccess.minimal copied to dist/
```

#### In "Verify build output" section:
```
✅ .htaccess found!
```

#### In "Create deployment package" section:
```
✓ Copied .htaccess
✓ Copied .htaccess.minimal
```

#### In "Create deployment zip" section (NEW!):
```
📦 Deployment zip created

🔍 Verifying zip contents:
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
     1736  10-13-2025 10:14   .htaccess
      210  10-13-2025 10:14   .htaccess.minimal
     ...

🔍 Looking for .htaccess in zip:
✅ .htaccess IS in the zip file!
```

**If you see "✅ .htaccess IS in the zip file!" → IT WORKED!**

## 📦 **How to Download & Extract**

### Step 1: Download Artifact
1. Go to workflow run page
2. Scroll to "Artifacts" section
3. Click "deployment" to download
4. You'll get: `deployment.zip`

### Step 2: Extract the Artifact
1. Extract `deployment.zip`
2. Inside you'll find: `elektr-ame-deployment.zip`
3. Extract `elektr-ame-deployment.zip`

### Step 3: Verify .htaccess is There

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd elektr-ame-deployment/
ls -la | grep htaccess

# Should show:
# -rw-r--r--  ... .htaccess
# -rw-r--r--  ... .htaccess.minimal
```

**On Windows:**
- File Explorer → View → Show → Hidden items
- You should see `.htaccess` and `.htaccess.minimal`

**If you DON'T see them:**
- Your extraction tool might hide them
- Use 7-Zip or WinRAR with "Show hidden files" enabled
- Or use command line: `unzip -l elektr-ame-deployment.zip`

---

## 📤 **How to Upload to OVH**

### Method 1: FTP Client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, etc.)

1. **Enable showing hidden files in FTP client:**
   - FileZilla: Server → Force showing hidden files
   - Cyberduck: View → Show Hidden Files

2. **Upload everything from extracted folder:**
   - Upload to: `/home/elektry/www/`
   - Include `.htaccess` and `.htaccess.minimal`

### Method 2: cPanel File Manager

1. **Enable showing hidden files:**
   - Settings (top right) → Show Hidden Files (dotfiles)
   - Click "Reload"

2. **Upload files:**
   - Navigate to `/home/elektry/www/`
   - Upload all files including `.htaccess`

### Method 3: Command Line (SSH)

```bash
# Upload the zip
scp elektr-ame-deployment.zip user@server:/home/elektry/

# SSH to server
ssh user@server

# Extract (preserves hidden files)
cd /home/elektry
unzip -o elektr-ame-deployment.zip -d www/

# Verify
ls -la www/ | grep htaccess
```

---

## ✅ **Testing After Upload**

### Test 1: Check Files on Server
```bash
ssh user@server
cd /home/elektry/www
ls -la | grep htaccess

# Should show:
# -rw-r--r-- ... .htaccess
```

### Test 2: Test HTTPS Redirect
```bash
curl -I http://www.elektr-ame.com

# Should show:
# HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# Location: https://www.elektr-ame.com
```

### Test 3: Check Browser
1. Visit: `http://www.elektr-ame.com`
2. Should redirect to: `https://www.elektr-ame.com`
3. Should see padlock 🔒 in address bar

### Test 4: Check PWA
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Console: Should see `[PWA] Service Worker registered`
3. Application → Manifest: Should show Elektr-Âme details
4. Wait 5 seconds: Install prompt should appear

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### "I still don't see .htaccess after extracting"

**Problem:** Your extraction tool is hiding it.

**Solution 1:** Use command line
```bash
unzip -l elektr-ame-deployment.zip | grep htaccess
# This will show if .htaccess is in the zip
```

**Solution 2:** Use different extraction tool
- Windows: Use 7-Zip (free) instead of built-in
- Mac: Use command line `unzip` instead of Finder
- Linux: `unzip -o elektr-ame-deployment.zip`

---

### "Files extracted but not uploading to server"

**Problem:** FTP client hiding/skipping hidden files.

**Solution:**
1. **FileZilla:** Server → Force showing hidden files → Transfer
2. **Cyberduck:** View → Show Hidden Files → Upload
3. **cPanel:** Settings → Show Hidden Files (dotfiles) → Upload

Or use SSH/SCP which always preserves hidden files.

---

### "Uploaded but HTTPS redirect not working"

**Problem 1:** mod_rewrite not enabled
- **Solution:** Contact OVH support to enable Apache mod_rewrite

**Problem 2:** File permissions
```bash
chmod 644 /home/elektry/www/.htaccess
```

**Problem 3:** OVH panel conflicting
- **Solution:** Check OVH control panel → Disable conflicting redirects

**Problem 4:** Browser cache
- **Solution:** Test in incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N)

## 📝 **Summary**

### What Was Wrong:
1. ❌ Vite didn't copy hidden files → Fixed with custom plugin
2. ❌ GitHub Actions copy didn't work → Fixed with explicit copy

1. ✅ Vite copies `.htaccess` to `dist/`
2. ✅ GitHub Actions copies to `deployment-package/`
3. ✅ ZIP creation preserves hidden files
4. ✅ Artifact download includes `.htaccess`
5. ✅ Extract → Upload → HTTPS works!

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. ✅ Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (2-3 minutes)
2. ✅ Check workflow log for "✅ .htaccess IS in the zip file!"
3. ✅ Download artifact
4. ✅ Extract TWICE (deployment.zip → elektr-ame-deployment.zip)
5. ✅ Verify .htaccess present (use `ls -la`)
6. ✅ Upload to OVH (enable "show hidden files")
7. ✅ Test HTTPS redirect
8. ✅ Test PWA features
